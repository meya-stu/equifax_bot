      You have the ability to edit your time unless timesheets are locked for payroll processing (from the timesheet deadline for the period until the following Wednesday morning).
      To correct time worked, double click the incorrect time block and enter the correct information. Submit the timesheet for manager approval. 
      For time off, choose “Correct Time Off” from the “Time” worklet.
      Click on the time block that requires adjustment. If the time-off type was incorrect, check the box beside the incorrect entry, and choose the correct time off type from the drop down menu. 
      If the time off needs to be removed entirely, simply click the “-“ beside the row to remove the request.
      After making the appropriate change, choose “Continue” and then “Submit” to send the correction to your manager for approval.
